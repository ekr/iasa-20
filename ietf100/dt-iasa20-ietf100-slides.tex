\item Draft Updates (-00 --> -01)
\item Reflections on feedback

\begin{slide}

\heading{Updates from -00}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Augmented background material
\item Major re-work of problem statement
\item Enhanced discussion of goals
\item Added more detail to description of three options
\item More detail on board/council
\item Added discussion of funding aspects
\item Updated discussion of options versus stated goals
\end{itemize}
}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Reflections on feedback}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Very thankful for feedback already received!
\item Feedback broken out by major topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Options (IASA++, Subsidiary, Independent)
\item ISOC relationship
\item Staff
\item IETF Trust
\item IETF vs IETFADminOrg roles
\item Funding
\item Advisory Council
\item Volunteers
\item Comparisons
\item Missing items
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{IASA 2.0 Options Feedback}
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item IETF must become aware of costs
\item Options are points along a trajectory/spectrum
\begin{itemize}
\item IASA++ represents a range of options from do nothing onwards
\item Mark a point along the continuum so we agree on what we are discussing
\end{itemize}
\item Worth having a clear organizational boundary
\item Subsidiary just adds bureaucracy and distance from funding source
\item IETF needs to be able to make administrative decisions independent of ISOC
\item Legal roles matter. If final authority is ISOC, doesn't meet autonomy/accountability goals 
\end{itemize}
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{ISOC Relationship}
\begin{itemize}
\item As long as the IETF is largely reliant on ISOC for funding, ISOC will have a degree of control regardless of formal independence
\item IASA++ could be seen as a stronger integration with ISOC (which could also be a good thing); this isn?t described in the document
\item Legal constraints will affect administrative decisions and put risks on ISOC; hasn't been an issue in the past
\item ISOC subsidiary : The option of ISOC re-absorbing the functions probably goes against IETF community desires
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Staff}
\begin{itemize}
\item IAOC gets to participate in the employee performance review and other processes already now
\item Performance review and other decisions today are not actually the IAOC's, but ISOC's.  ISOC is the employer
\item Objection to needing Communications Director position, or a director-level of that position
\item Worried about staff capture
\item Agree that staffing needs to be enhanced, but disagree about the characterization of past issues with coordinating among IAOC, ISOC, and HR
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Trust, Roles, and Funding}
\begin{itemize}
\item IETF Trust
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Don't move Trust to IETFAdminOrg
\item The IETF Trust is a whole different discussion, details deserve further thought. Say that the evolution of the IETF Trust will be addressed separately at a later date
\end{itemize}
}
\item IETF vs IETFADminOrg roles
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item What does emphasizing difference between IETFAdminOrg and IETF accomplish?
\item The role of IETF chair vs. IETFAdminOrg Exec Director is not clear
\end{itemize}
}
\item Funding
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item We need an IETF-ISOC agreement on funding even for IASA++, lack of this agreement is what is causing current lack of clarity
\item Would like to talk about more predictable level of funding overall, not just from ISOC
\end{itemize}
}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Advisory Council, Volunteers, and Comparisons}
\begin{itemize}
\item Advisory Council
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Is this just an extra layer? Is it needed?
\end{itemize}
}
\item Volunteers
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item We should consider obtaining formal commitments from volunteers
\end{itemize}
}
\item Comparisons
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison wrt funding arrangements and staff is not fair to IASA++
\item Comparison in Section 6.1. on whether the financial arrangements are clear is 100\%
dependent on the clarity of accounting, and the current text is unfair to IASA++
\end{itemize}
}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Missing Items}
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item If there is going to be a new entity, need to focus on:
\begin{itemize}
\item How the board is formed
\item What resources are shared with ISOC
\end{itemize}

\item Would like to understand the impact of reduced volunteer availability of reduced external sponsorship to the different options
\item Document should discuss the impact to IRTF and IAB
\item The fund-raising responsibilities, accounting of costs, re-envisioned funding model have a clear monetary motive, transparency has a community motive, but other changes have less clearly motivated background
\item The role of IAB as an advisor to ISOC is not discussed
\item The oversight discussion lacks the recognition of possible conflict of interest for oversight persons (IAOC) and volunteer workers in IASA overlap
\end{itemize}
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Possible draft edits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Address editorial issues identified
\item Tighten up links between Problem Statement items and Goals
\item Begin adding more details to options (see next slide)
\item Others?
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Way forward}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fleshing out all three options is time-consuming
\item Suggestion: Pick a single option to deep dive the details
\item Discuss...
\end{itemize}

\end{slide}
