%\vspace{-8ex}         %for long lists
\begin{itemize}
\item Problems, goals and options for IASA evolution
\item Draft Updates (-00 to -01)
\item Reflections on feedback
\item Way forward
\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Why are we here?}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes in IETF administrative tasks over the past 10 years
\item Changes in the IETF community's expectations for the administrative functions
\item Changes in the world around us
\item \textbf{What administrative arrangement best supports the IETF going forward?}
\end{itemize}
}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Problems}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lack of Clarity}
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Responsibility - Demarcation between IETF and ISOC not clear
      \item Representation - Who speaks for the IETF (ISOC, IETF Chair, IAOC, ...)
      \item Authority - Decision-making with and without ISOC approval
      \item Oversight - Reporting chains
   \end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Lack of Resources}
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Volunteers - Lack of qualified volunteers to staff IAOC
      \item Staff - IAD role overly complex and taxing
   \end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Lack of Transparency} - Perception that IAOC is not transparent enough
\item \textbf{Funding/Operating Model Mismatch}
\end{itemize}
}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Goals}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Protect IETF Culture} - Keep financial support independent of technical contributions
\item \textbf{Improve Technical Environment} - Undertake changes to better enable technical contributors to make technical contributions
\item \textbf{Clear Definition of IETF/ISOC Relationship}
\item \textbf{Re-envisioned Funding Model} - Provide support needed to adapt the funding model to changes in the industry
\item \textbf{Clarity in IETF/ISOC Financial Arrangements}
\end{itemize}
}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Goals}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Clarity in Roles \& Responsibilities} - Clearly document roles of staff, contractors, and volunteers
\item \textbf{Define Support Staff Roles \& Responsibilities}
\item \textbf{Re-define Role of IETF Community vis-a-vis Administrative Activities} - As administrative responsibilities change for staff \& volunteers, the role of the community will change must be better defined
\item \textbf{Define Improved Transparency Requirements}
\item \textbf{Define a Transition Plan} - How do we get from today's structure to the new structure?
\end{itemize}
}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Transition Options}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item{Structure}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{IASA++} - IETF administrative structure implemented as an activity within ISOC
      \item \textbf{ISOC Subsidiary} - IETF administrative structure implemented as ISOC subsidiary with its own accounts, by-laws, charter, staff, etc.
      \item \textbf{Independent Organization} - IETF administrative structure exists in a new non-profit organization with its own accounts, by-laws, charter, etc.
   \end{itemize}
\item All options still have funding dependencies on ISOC
\item Need to define relationship between IETF administrative organization and ISOC
\item Governance
\item Increase or reorganization of staff resources
\end{itemize}
}

\end{slide}

%\begin{slide}

%\heading{Updates from -00}

%{\footnotesize
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Augmented background material
%\item Major re-work of problem statement
%\item Enhanced discussion of goals
%\item Added more detail to description of three options
%\item More detail on board/council
%\item Added discussion of funding aspects
%\item Updated discussion of options versus stated goals
%\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}

\heading{Reflections on feedback}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Very thankful for feedback already received!
\item Feedback broken out by major topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Options (IASA++, Subsidiary, Independent)
  % to discuss: Options are points along a trajectory/spectrum
  % to discuss: Clear organizational boundary vs. new organisation adds bureaucracy
\item ISOC relationship
  % to discuss: As long as the IETF is largely reliant on ISOC for funding, ISOC will have a degree of control regardless of formal independence
  % to discuss: The level at which the subs/indep model should change the budgeting or funding
\item Staff
  % to discuss: The bigger role of staff / increased staff
\item IETF Trust
  % to discuss: Suggest keeping IETF Trust separate from this reorganisation
\item IETF vs IETFADminOrg roles
  % example: The role of IETF chair vs. IETFAdminOrg Exec Director is not clear
\item Funding
  % example: need an IETF-ISOC agreement on funding for all options
\item Advisory Council
  % example: had question marks about this
\item Volunteers
  % example: We should consider obtaining formal commitments from volunteers
\item Comparisons
  % example: Several updates, will fix: e.g., whether the financial arrangements are clear is 100% dependent on accounting
\item Missing items
  % example: 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{IASA 2.0 Options Feedback}
{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
%%% \item IETF must become aware of costs
\item Options are points along a trajectory/spectrum
\begin{itemize}
\item IASA++ represents a range of options from do nothing onwards
\item Mark a point along the continuum so we agree on what we are discussing
\end{itemize}
\item ``Worth having a clear organizational boundary'' vs. ``subsidiary just adds bureaucracy and distance from funding source''
\item Solving specific problematic issues vs. evolving basic organisational design to reduce issues
%%% \item IETF needs to be able to make administrative decisions independent of ISOC
%%% \item Legal roles matter. If final authority is ISOC, doesn't meet autonomy/accountability goals 
\end{itemize}
}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

\heading{ISOC Relationship}
\begin{itemize}
\item As long as the IETF is largely reliant on ISOC for funding, ISOC will have a degree of control regardless of formal independence
\item Important to retain close relationship with ISOC
\item To which extent should the subsidiary or independent options change the way IETF does budgeting or funding
%%% \item IASA++ could be seen as a stronger integration with ISOC (which could also be a good thing); this isn't described in the document
%%% \item Legal constraints will affect administrative decisions and put risks on ISOC; hasn't been an issue in the past
%%% \item ISOC subsidiary : The option of ISOC re-absorbing the functions probably goes against IETF community desires
\item Specifying how future evolution in the interface happens
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Staff}
\begin{itemize}
\item The bigger role of staff or contractors, increased number of people working for the IETF
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some growth seems unavoidable
  \item Need to ensure our oversight, control, roles are clear
  \end{itemize}
%%% \item IAOC gets to participate in the employee performance review and other processes already now
%%% \item Performance review and other decisions today are not actually the IAOC's, but ISOC's.  ISOC is the employer
%%% \item Objection to needing Communications Director position, or a director-level of that position
%%% \item Worried about staff capture
%%% \item Agree that staffing needs to be enhanced, but disagree about the characterization of past issues with coordinating among IAOC, ISOC, and HR
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Trust, Roles}
\begin{itemize}
\item Keep IETF Trust out of this reorganisation
%%% {\footnotesize
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item Don't move Trust to IETFAdminOrg
%%% \item The IETF Trust is a whole different discussion, details deserve further thought. Say that the evolution of the IETF Trus%%% t will be addressed separately at a later date
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% }
%%% \item IETF vs IETFADminOrg roles
%%% {\footnotesize
%%% \begin{itemize}
\item What does emphasizing difference between IETFAdminOrg and IETF accomplish?
%%% \item The role of IETF chair vs. IETFAdminOrg Exec Director is not clear
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% }
%%% \item Funding
%%% {\footnotesize
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item We need an IETF-ISOC agreement on funding even for IASA++, lack of this agreement is what is causing current lack of clarity
%%% \item Would like to talk about more predictable level of funding overall, not just from ISOC
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% }
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%% \begin{slide}
%%% \heading{Advisory Council, Volunteers, and Comparisons}
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item Advisory Council
%%% {\footnotesize
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item Is this just an extra layer? Is it needed?
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% }
%%% \item Volunteers
%%% {\footnotesize
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item We should consider obtaining formal commitments from volunteers
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% }
%%% \item Comparisons
%%% {\footnotesize
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item Comparison wrt funding arrangements and staff is not fair to IASA++
%%% \item Comparison in Section 6.1. on whether the financial arrangements are clear is 100\%
%%% dependent on the clarity of accounting, and the current text is unfair to IASA++
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% }
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% \end{slide}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Missing Items}
%%% {\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
%%% \item If there is going to be a new entity, need to focus on:
%%% \begin{itemize}
%%% \item How the board is formed
%%% \item What resources are shared with ISOC
%%% \end{itemize}
%%% 
%%% \item Would like to understand the impact of reduced volunteer availability of reduced external sponsorship to the different options
\item Document should discuss the impact to IRTF and IAB, IETFAdminOrg serves more than IETF (and role of IAB for ISOC)
%%% \item The fund-raising responsibilities, accounting of costs, re-envisioned funding model have a clear monetary motive, transparency has a community motive, but other changes have less clearly motivated background (and role of IAB for ISOC)
%%% \item The oversight discussion lacks the recognition of possible conflict of interest for oversight persons (IAOC) and volunteer workers in IASA overlap
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

\heading{Way forward}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fleshing out all three options is time-consuming
\item Suggestion: Pick a direction and work out the details, including a draft transition plan
\item Discuss...
\end{itemize}
