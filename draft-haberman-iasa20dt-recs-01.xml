    <abstract>
      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF were
      created more than ten years ago. Since then, there has been considerable change in the
      tasks and in our own expectations. The IETF community has
      discussed these changes and the problems they cause. The community has
      some sense of the properties they expect from future arrangements,
      including structural and organizational changes, changes to volunteer and
      staff personnel resources, and transparency changes.</t>

      <t>This document is a product of a design team, focused on providing
      additional information to the community about solution options, as well as
      supporting analysis of the implications of those options.  To be clear,
      the community is responsible for adopting any recommendations or making any final
      decisions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF
      (referred to as the "IETF Administrative Support Activity" (IASA) <xref target="RFC4071"/>) were created more than ten years ago,
      when the IETF initially took charge of its own administration. The
      arrangements have served the IETF reasonably well, but there's been considerable
      change in the necessary tasks, in the world around us, and our own
      expectations since the creation of the IASA. What administrative arrangements
      best support the IETF in the next ten years?</t>

      <t>The system has experienced various challenges and frustrations along the
      way, for instance around meeting arrangements. There are also some bigger
      questions about how the organisations are structured, for instance about the
      division of responsibilities between IETF and ISOC.</t>

      <t>The IETF community has discussed and continues to discuss these topics, most
      recently on the "IASA 2.0" mailing list and BOF at IETF98. Alissa Cooper, the
      Chair of the IETF, convened a small design team to start evaluating potential
      options going forward. The purpose of the design team is to provide material
      that informs the community discussion, both in terms of providing a bit more
      worked through solution ideas, as well as supporting analysis of the implications
      of those options. This information, along with all other input provided in the
      discussion, hopefully helps the community and IETF leadership decide what next
      steps to take.</t>

      <t>To be clear, the community is in charge of adopting any recommendations
      or making any decisions. This draft, the output of the design team's
      considerations, has no particular official standing.</t>

      <t>An initial version of this draft was published, after which the authors
      sought feedback particularly on two aspects:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>If the set of options outlined in the draft covers the
        options that should be looked at.</t>
        <t>If the analysis of the implications of the options is
        correct.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Following discussion before, during, and after IETF-99, it has become feasible to discuss more
      concrete conclusions and which recommendations the
      community should consider adopting. It should also be noted that IETF administrative
      matters have been organised jointly with ISOC, and it is important that
      ISOC will continue to be involved in the process of looking at the reorganisation.</t>

      <t>As a base for this work there was a good articulation of the set of problems we
      are facing in <xref target="I-D.hall-iasa20-workshops-report"/> and
      <xref target="I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective"/>. The community discussion
      seems have indicated also some of the outcome properties that are expected.
      The scope of the solutions explored included:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Structural and organizational changes, both externally (with ISOC and contractors)
        and internally (within the IAOC and subcommittees)</t>
        <t>Changes to personnel resources, both volunteer and paid</t>
        <t>Transparency changes</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Changes to the funding model are out of scope to the extent they fall outside the
      categories above.</t>

      <t>The rest of the document is organised as follows. The next two sections (<xref target="background" /> and <xref target="challenges" />) describe
      the background and summarise the challenges noted in the community discussion.
      The two sections after that (<xref target="consider_change" /> and <xref target="reorg_options" />) explain what categories of changes were considered,
      and describe the primary options for structural changes. The following two sections (<xref target="analysis" /> and <xref target="conc_recs" />) focus on analysis of the different
      options along with conclusions and recommendations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Background" anchor="background">

      <t>The administrative support structure is intended to be responsive to the administrative
      needs of the IETF technical community.</t>

      <t>RFC 4071 <xref target="RFC4071" /> defines the current IETF Administrative Support
      Activity (IASA). It is an activity housed within the Internet Society (ISOC), as is
      the rest of the IETF.  RFC 4071 defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), the IETF Administrative Director (IAD),
      and ISOC in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.
      It also defines the membership and selection rules for the IAOC.</t>

      <t>As RFC 4071 notes, IASA is distinct from IETF-related technical functions, such
      as the RFC Editor, the IANA, and the IETF standards process itself.  The IASA has
      no influence on the technical decisions of the IETF or on the technical contents
      of IETF work.</t>

      <t>Today, IASA's activities support a number of functions within the IETF system:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Meeting planning</t>
	<t>Budget and financial management</t>
        <t>Contracting with and overseeing the secretariat</t>
        <t>Contracting with and overseeing the RFC Editor (together with the IAB)</t>
        <t>Contracting with and overseeing IANA (together with the IAB)</t>
        <t>Legal ownership of IETF materials, domain names and copyright</t>
        <t>Ownership of IANA-related domain names and copyright</t>
	<t>General legal support (including topics beyond domains and IPR)</t>
        <t>IETF website</t>
        <t>IETF IT services</t>
        <t>Tooling support, maintenance, and development (together with volunteers)</t>
        <t>Meeting network support</t>
        <t>Remote attendance support</t>
        <t>Communications assistance for the IETF</t>
        <t>Sponsorship and funding (together with ISOC)</t>
      </list></t>

      <section title="Terminology"  anchor="terms">

        <t>The following acronyms are used in this document:

        <list style="symbols">

          <t>IASA - IETF Administrative Support Activity - An organized activity that
	  provides administrative support for the IETF, the IAB and the IESG.</t>

          <t>IAOC - IETF Administrative Oversight Committee in the current IASA system - A largely
          IETF-selected committee that oversees and directs IASA.  Accountable to the IETF
          community.</t>

          <t>IAOC committees - Recognizing the need for specialized attention for different
          branches of work requiring IAOC oversight, the IAOC expanded its support by creating
          committees. Currently, the committees do the heavy lifting on specific tasks, while
          the IAOC is the one responsible for final decisions.</t>

          <t>ISOC - The Internet Society - The organizational home of the IETF, and one that in the
          current IASA system assists the IETF with legal, administrative, and funding tasks.</t>

          <t>IAD - IETF Administrative Director - In the current system, the sole staff member
          responsible for carrying out the work of the IASA.  An ISOC employee.</t>

          <t>IETF Trust - In the current system the IETF Trust acquires, maintains, and licenses
          intellectual and other property used in connection with the administration of the IETF.
          Same composition as IAOC.</t>

    <section anchor="challenges" title="Challenges">

      <t>Discussion leading to this document has been framed by the issues discussed on IETF
      mailing lists and documented elsewhere  <xref target="I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective"/>,
      <xref target="I-D.hall-iasa20-workshops-report"/>,
      <xref target="I-D.arkko-ietf-iasa-thoughts"/>.  The reader is referred to those
      documents and ongoing discussion on the IASA20@ietf.org mailing list for fuller
      details on the range of challenges facing the IETF in its handling of administrative
      matters.</t>

      <t>In summary, the key areas of challenge that have shaped this work are:

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>The range of IETF administrative tasks have grown considerably; we must ensure that we
        have the right structure, community involvement and level of staffing to
        address them effectively and efficiently.</t>

        <t>The relationship and division of responsibilities between the IETF and ISOC have changed,
        as both organizations have grown considerably in the last decade.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The joint organisation that supports the IETF has grown rather organically, and
        would benefit from re-assessment and possible reorganisation.
        </t>

        <t>Community expectations of transparency of administrative actions
        and execution from the administration could be improved.</t>

        <t>Lack of predictably of funding levels combined with regular shortfalls due to fluctuations in revenue from IETF meetings.
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

        We face continued challenges related to funding IETF activities on a background of
	increasing costs. We must properly manage expectations about locations of meetings
        (broadening of IETF engagement, sponsor preferences, which can lead to increased costs 
		or decreased attendance for a specific meeting) while balancing against
        operational practicalities.  And we must ensure that we continue to not be influenced by
        funding entities on the technical work of the IETF.</t>

      </list></t>

      <t>Of the items above, the first two are largely to be addressed by structural
      updates, while the others are more about discussing tradeoffs, improving work processes, and
      updating documented expectations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Considering a Change" anchor="consider_change">

      <t>Given that a change seems necessary, what might that change include? There
      seem to be three broad categories of IETF organisation that will be affected:

      <list style="numbers">
        <t>overall structure</t>
        <t>oversight</t>
        <t>interfaces and expectations to rest of the IETF</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>The overall structure also includes questions such as whether IETF is an organisation and its relationship to ISOC.</t>

      <t>There are some interconnections between different aspects of
      reorganisation. For instance, how IETF defines its relationship to ISOC will
      have some implications on what kind of oversight structure is needed;
      a more independent, free-standing organisational model for IETF
      would imply new functions for the IASA.</t>

      <t>There are a number of choices to make within the reorganisation effort. In particular,
      IETF's relationship to ISOC could be arranged in a fundamentally similar manner than
      it is today, but improved, e.g., to make clear who is expected to control a particular
      part of the operation. But the relationship could also be arranged in a different way,
      for instance, as a subsidiary of ISOC or as a more free-standing, independent organisational
      unit.</t>

      <section anchor="problemstmt" title="Problem Statement">

	<t>The purpose of this part of the document is to describe a
	few problem areas with enough detail to allow the comparison
	of potential IASA structure updates (among themselves, as well
	as comparison to the status quo). This is intentionally
	illustrative, rather than an exhaustive enumeration of all
	possible and perceived issues with the current structure and
	implementation. Nevertheless, the examples are concrete and
	real.  (For a fuller description of the perceived issues with
	the current IASA arrangements, see TBD).</t>

	<section title="Lack of Clarity">

	  <t>In general, as the IETF has grown and aged, an increasing
	  lack of clarity exists in a number of specific areas. We
	  discuss four areas where this lack of clarity is
	  specifically acute: responsibility, representation,
	  authority, and oversight.</t>

	  <section title="Responsibility">

	    <t>The line between the IETF and ISOC is not
	    organizationally clear-cut, which has led to issues around
	    transparency, allocation of staff time and priorities,
	    budgeting, and clarity of who is responsible for what.</t>

	    <t>Often, in can be unclear what part of the IETF or ISOC
	    is responsible for a particular function. Things as simple
	    as ensuring there is a lanyard sponsor/coordinator, but
	    also functions as important as fundraising and sponsorship
	    development can suffer from a lack of clear
	    responsibility.</t>

	  </section>

	  <section title="Representation">

	    <t>The respective roles of ISOC, the IETF chair, the IAOC,
	    and the secretariat in representing the IETF to sponsors
	    and donors and communicating with them are not clear.</t>

	    <t>Having ISOC represent the IETF to sponsors and donors:

	    <list style="symbols">
	      <t>creates confusion about why the IETF does not
	      represent itself,</t>
	      <t>yields questions about why ISOC does not instead
	      increase its IETF support and how donations can be
	      guaranteed to be dedicated to the IETF, and</t>
	      <t>can result in those soliciting sponsorships and
	      donations having a lack of familiarity with IETF
	      work.</t>
	    </list>
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Authority">
	    <t>Another significant problem concerns authority, and to
	    what extent can IETF make decisions on its own in the
	    current structure compared to decisions that require ISOC
	    approval and agreement.</t>

	    <t>Example: Due to IETF's lack of legal status,
	    contractual agreements must be signed by ISOC on behalf of
	    the IETF.  There are occasions when a decision that is
	    right for the IETF and desired by IETF leadership cannot
	    be executed due to constraints posed by what ISOC can and
	    cannot agree to itself. For example, when IETF sought to
	    acquire a recent piece of software for business purposes,
	    ISOC would initially not agree to entering into an
	    agreement with the software provider. Ideally, IETF could
	    make decisions free from operational and other constraints
	    imposed by its relationship with ISOC.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Oversight">
	    <t>The IAOC is the primary oversight body in the current
	    IASA model, but there can be confusion or mismatches in
	    roles. For example, the IAOC has an administrative staffer
	    that is an ISOC employee, but does this role ultimately
	    report to the IAOC committe, the IAD, or ISOC staff?</t>
	  </section>

	</section>

	<section title="Lack of Resources">
	  <t>IETF faces growing constraints on resources essential for
	  IETF to function, notably in volunteers, staff, and
	  time.</t>

	  <section title="Volunteers">
	    <t>As the IAD is the sole FTE for IETF, naturally the IASA
	    arrangement has evolved to encompass a series of volunteer
	    committees that help to work through issues such as
	    finance, legal, meetings, technology management, requests
	    for proposals, and sponsorship.  Volunteers have limited
	    time and specific interests and there does not ever seem
	    to be enough volunteers to effectively populate these
	    committees.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Staff">
	    <t>IETF faces serious constraints on staff capacity under
	    the current IASA model. The one IAD role and support from
	    contractors have been used to assure that capacity needed
	    is for the most part in place. However, it seems clear
	    that the IAD role is overly complex and taxing for a
	    single human at this point, necessitating measures such as
	    providing an administrator for the IAOC to better run that
	    body and their meetings.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Time">
	    <t>(JLH: Not sure what to highlight here.)</t>
	  </section>

	</section>

	<section title="Lack of Transparency">
	  <t>IAOC has typically been perceived to operate less
	  transparently than what is the norm for IETF processes and
	  other IETF leadership bodies.</t>

	  <t>Lack of transparency has some roots in concerns about
	  confidentiality of contract terms and business
	  relationships, and fear of community reaction to
	  administrative decisions.</t>

	  <t>Requirements from the community about IAOC transparency
	  expectations are not clear.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Funding/Operating Model Mismatch and Rising Costs">

	  <t>Meeting fees are currently an important source of
	  revenue, but the emergence of more viable remote participation tools 
		  and other factors are likely
	  responsible for declining in-person meeting attendance going
	  forward.  Even if fees were charged for remote
	  participation, charging the same for remote and in-person
	  attendance is unlikely to be a viable way to make up the
	  difference.</t>

	  <t>While there has been a lot of sponsor support for, e.g.,
	  meeting hosting, getting support for the full costs of operating the IETF
	   is not easy.  The costs are quite large, the value to sponsors is not always
	  obvious, the IETF community is sometimes critical or
	  unappreciative, and the same sponsors get tapped again and
	  again for many related but different opportunities.</t>

	  <t>In addition, relying heavily on meeting-based revenue is somewhat at
	  odds with the fact that much of the IETF's work takes place
	  outside of in- person meetings.</t>

	  <t>The IETF is increasingly relying on professional services
	  to support its activities, in order to more efficiently operate the IETF's 
		  activities better enable IETF participants to contribute to the IETF's 
		  core technical work rather than administrative and supporting activities work, 
		  which is also causing expenses to grow.</t>
	</section>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="goals" title="Goals">

        <t>The IASA redesign effort needs to address the main issues listed above in the <xref target="problemstmt"/>. More
        specifically, a new organisational structure needs to do at least the following:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Protect the IETF's Culture and Technical Work: Ensure that future IASA organizational structure and 
		  processes preserves and protects the IETF's unique culture of individual contribution, clear 
		  separation of financial support from technical work, as well as the "rough consensus and running code" approach to
		  the development of open Internet standards.</t>
		
	  <t>Improve the IETF's Technical Environment: Undertake changes to better enable technical contributors to focus more
		on that technical work and less on administrative work or support activities. This could for example mean directing more 
		  financial resources towards the creation of new or improvement of existing tools, which might be produced by 
		  contractors rather than solely by volunteers. As a result, volunteers could instead focus on developing the 
		  standards themselves. Thus, if the core competency of IETF attendees and their reason of participating in the IETF 
		  is to develop standards, then create an environment where they can focus exclusively on that activity and delegate 
		  to contractors, staff, or other resources the responsibility for creating and maintaining tools and processes to 
		  support this activity.</t>
		
	  <t>Define a New IETF-ISOC Relationship: Define the roles of IETF and ISOC in a way that helps the above structure be 
		  as clear as possible, in terms of who does what, how are things accounted for, and who is in charge
		  of adjustments and control (e.g., staff resources). This also includes consideration of a new funding model 
		  that takes into account the historical responsibility for the IETF that ISOC has had since its inception.</t>
		  
	  <t>Clarify Overall Roles and Responsibilities: Ensure that all staff, contractor, and volunteer roles are clearly documented. 
		This necessarily includes documenting how each of these parties may interact or interface with one another in order to 
		  conduct and support the business of the IETF. This also includes documenting key work processes, decision-making 
		  processes and authority (such as pertaining to meeting venue selection), etc. A key objective is to minimize ambiguity 
		and uncertainty so that it is clear who is responsible for what and who has the power to make certain decisions.</t>
		
	  <t>Define a New Long-Term Funding Model: A redesign needs to update and improve the financial arrangement 
		  between IETF and ISOC. It must also be clear to people outside the IETF and ISOC organisations (e.g., sponsors) 
		  what the arrangements are and what their contributions affect and do not affect.</t>

          <t>Define Support Staff Roles and Responsibilities: Very clearly define the roles of the oversight entities and 
		  staff/contractors to match the expanded work scope facing the IETF. Ensure that any changes create a structure that 
		  can adapt flexibly to future growth and other changes (including changes in IETF community expectations, 
		  such as increased transparency or more rapid decision-making).</t>

          <t>Re-Define the Role of the IETF Community in Relation to Administrative Activities: As the roles and responsibilities 
		  for support staff and volunteer roles are clarified more precisely, the role of the IETF community in 
		  relation to those staff and voluneer roles must be better defined. This should acknowlege the limited 
		  time and availability of IETF volunteers, better defining expectations around oversight of and involvement 
		  in strategic, operational, and execution tasks within the administrative efforts. The new design needs to 
		  ensure that volunteers are not overloaded in such things as low level operational decisions, which can be delegated
		   to and handled by staff, and can instead focus on strategic changes, critical decisions, and so on. 
		  In particulat, this should focus on clearly documenting the lines between responsibility, representation, 
		  authority, and oversight.</t>

          <t>Define Improved Transparency Requirememts: The general level of transparency and information-sharing between 
		  IETF administrative staff and groups to the IETF community must be improved. This includes improving the timeliness 
		  of sharing of information and decisions, as well as seeking comment on prospective decisions. As the same time, 
		  we need to reset expectations around delegated authority so that once staff or an administrative support organization 
		  has been delegated certain authority it is clear that they are empowered to proceed in a particular area, so as 
		to improve organizational efficiency, reduce friction, and improve the pace of work and decision-making. However, 
		it is clear that enabling a group or staff to act within their delegated authority depends upon more clear definition 
		of roles and responsibilities, on improved transparency, on improved communications, and on trust (which is 
		  built upon all of those things over time).</t>

	  <t>Define a New IASA 2.0 Team: Determine what new IASA structure we need and define a transition plan from the model the IETF 
		  has today to the new structure.</t>

    <section title="Reorganisation Options" anchor="reorg_options">

      <section title="Overall Structure">

        <t>The design team believes that there
        are three general approaches to evolving the IASA function. The options
        generally focus on the relationship between the IETF and ISOC. Changes to
        this relationship directly affect how the IASA function gets carried out.</t>

	<t>It
        should be noted that all three options require more administrative budget
        per year than what is currently allocated for IASA functions. In addition,
        they will most likely require a more predictable level of ISOC funding,
        rather than the current model of a base funding level combined with
        periodic infusions to cover shortfalls.</t>

        <t>The following
        subsections describe each option. <xref target="analysis"/> highlights their
        pros and cons and effectiveness in comparison to the goals stated
        earlier.</t>

        <section title="IASA++">

          <t>In the IASA++ option, the IETF and ISOC maintain the current structural
          relationship.  This means that the IETF remains an organized activity of
          ISOC, ISOC maintains funds and contracting authority on behalf of the
          IETF, and all IASA staff are ISOC employees. In essence, this is today's model 
		with very minor improvements.</t>

          <t>While the relationship remains the same, the IETF and ISOC will make
          improvements to the relationship in order to enhance the functionality of the
          IETF. The following are some potential improvements that could be made under
          this approach:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Provide clarity and transparency about authority, responsibility,
            budgeting, and allocation of staff time for all IETF-related work and
            activities.</t>
            <t>Add IASA staff to better reflect the increased workload on what is
            now a single staff member.</t>
            <t>Provide clarity about authority of the IAOC in reviewing performance
            of IASA staff.</t>
            <t>Re-structure the internal IETF organization and appointment processes
            for the IAOC and the IETF Trust to address current challenges.</t>
            <t>Establish IETF community consensus about who has policy authority for
            administrative decisions where there is currently a lack of clarity.</t>
	  </list></t>

          <t>The key focus in implementing this option would be sorting out the roles
          and responsiblities of the IAOC and ISOC. The IETF needs to be able to make
          its own administrative decisions independent of ISOC. Having a concrete
          separation of roles and responsibilities will allow each organization to
          develop their own internal policies that meet their different operational
          needs. It should be noted that the IETF needs to keep abreast of changes to
          ISOC policies to ensure that the working arrangement remains smooth. Some
          examples of where the IAOC needs autonomy from ISOC policies include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Contract administration</t>
            <t>Spending authority limits</t>
            <t>Personnel decisions, including compensation</t>
          </list></t>

	  <t>Some specific changes to make these improvements are discussed in
	  <xref target="oversight"/> regarding board and staff work divisions.
	  While in this option there is no need for a formal board, there is
	  still a need to redefine the role of the IAOC. The necessary
	  staff changes are discussed in <xref target="staffresources"/>.</t>

	  <t>It would also be necessary to improve IAOC transparency. In the IASA++ option,
	  in addition to the general improvement needs in this area, there is an added need
	  to continue the improvements relating to accurate accounting of resources
	  and actions on the ISOC side. This relates directly to the delineation of roles
          and responsibilities necessary for the IAOC to operate independent of ISOC. Improved
          transparency will allow the IETF community to be more aware of IAOC operations and
          decisions. Such changes to the IAOC will require changes to <xref target="RFC4071" />.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="option2" title="ISOC Subsidiary">

          <t>In this option, an ISOC subsidiary would be created as the new legal
          home of the IETF, similar to how the Public Interest Registry (PIR) is 
		  organized within ISOC.  A subsidiary can have its own bank account, by-laws,
          charter, board of directors/trustees, staff, and corporate identity. As a
          subsidiary of ISOC, the IETF and ISOC can share overhead and
          resources. The IETF would likely rely heavily on contractors for most
          administrative tasks.</t>

          <t>As a subsidiary of ISOC, the IETF could eliminate the IAOC and replace
          it with a board of directors/trustees (see <xref target="oversight"/>).
	  Administrative decision-making
          authority would rest primarily with the administrative staff, with oversight
          provided by the board (see <xref target="staffresources"/>.
	  Exception cases could be developed where board
          approval would be required to authorize strategic decisions.</t>

          <t>Other likely changes could include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Transfer existing IETF-related contracts between ISOC and contractors
            to be between the subsidiary and contractors.</t>
            <t>Multiple options to structure community involvement in administrative
            decision-making (e.g., committees organized by subsidiary staff).</t>
          </list></t>

	  <t>There are also other possible changes that would need further
	  discussion:

	  <list style="symbols">
            <t>Eliminate the IETF Trust (or organize it within the new IETF organization) 
		    and have the IETF subsidiary assume
            responsibility for the IETF's intellectual property rights (IPR). This
	    would simplify the overall structure, but would also bundle the IPR with 
	    the rest of the IETF operations. Note that the IETF Trust currently holds IPR also on
	    behalf of the users of IANA.</t>
            <t>Transfer existing ISOC funds earmarked for the IETF to the subsidiary's
            bank account(s), and have future IETF income held in that subsidiary's bank
            account(s).</t>
          </list></t>

        </section>

        <section title="Independent Organization">

          <t>In this option, a new non-profit organization (e.g., IETForg) is
          created independent from ISOC as the new legal home of the IETF. IETForg
          would have its own bank account, by-laws, charter, board of
          directors/trustees, staff, and corporate identity. The administrative
          staff for IETForg could be kept lean and would likely rely on contractors for the
          bulk of administrative tasks. Minimally, the IETForg staff would be
          responsible for administration, development/fundraising, communications,
          and personnel management.</t>

          <t>As an independent organization, the IETF could eliminate the IAOC and
          replace it with a board of directors/trustees. Administrative (day-to-day) decision-making
          authority would rest primarily with IETForg staff and contractors, with oversight
          provided by the board. Exception cases could be developed where board
          approval would be required to authorize strategic decisions. Again, further
	  detais regarding the board and staff changes are in <xref target="oversight"/> 
	  and <xref target="staffresources"/>.</t>

          <t>Other likely changes could include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Transfer existing ISOC funds earmarked for the IETF to IETForg, and
            have future IETF income held by IETForg. ISOC would still be largest
            IETForg sponsor, if funding is maintained at current projections.</t>
            <t>Transfer existing IETF-related contracts between ISOC and contractors
            to be between IETForg and contractors.</t>
            <t>Multiple options to structure community involvement in administrative
            decision-making (e.g., committees organized by subsidiary staff).</t>
          </list></t>
	  
          <t>Other possible changes that may need more discussion would
          include possible change in the role of IETF Trust, as
          discussed in <xref target="option2"/>.</t>

        </section>

      </section>

      <section anchor="oversight" title="Oversight">

        <t>Oversight is obviously affected by what we decide to do with the
        relationship to ISOC. A bigger, more independent role for the IETF would
        require an IASA board to be designed for that. Nevertheless,
	some change in the role of an oversight body and the work division
	between it and staff is necessary in any case.</t>

        <t>Also, the design team believes the role of the community members serving in the
        IASA needs to be kept at a level appropriate for volunteer service (see
        community role in <xref target="challenges"/> and limits in <xref
        target="goals"/>).</t>

        <t>Beyond this, there are a number of choices in division of
        responsibilities and the structure of the organisation. The key decision
        points are:

        <list style="symbols">

          <t>Whether the community representative or board control of the IASA is at the
          level of individual administrative decisions (as it is today) or at a more
          traditional board level of control, i.e., strategic direction, budgets, and key
          personnel choices.</t>

          <t>Whether the interface to the community is via staff or a community
          representative or board function.</t>

        </list></t>

        <section anchor="optiona" title="Strategic Board">

          <t>In this option, the current IAOC is disbanded and replaced by a
          traditional oversight board, common in most non-profit organisations. This
          board, the IASA Board (IB), acts to set strategic direction for IETF
          administrative matters, sets budgets, provides fiscal oversight, provides
          high-level oversight about major new projects, and so on. The board is also
          responsible for hiring and assessing the performance of the Executive
          Director (the highest-level staff director, see <xref
          target="staffresources"/>).</t>

	  <t>This option is potentially valid for all overall structure choices
	  outlined in <xref target="reorg_options"/>. However, for the ISOC Subsidiary and
	  Independent Organisation options, the board would have to be a formal
	  board, typical of other non-profit organisations.</t>

          <t>The board works with staff who is empowered to carry out the operations
          as directed by the board. The staff is responsible for operating within
          the limits set by the board, and are accountable to the board. Including
          being hired and fired as needed. The staff's responsibilities include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>preparing for and making decisions on their agreed and budgeted areas
            (for example, meeting venue decisions)</t>
            <t>operational execution of these decisions, including contracting with
            vendors</t>
            <t>communicating with the community</t>
            <t>development of the IETF's administrative operation, in consultation
            with the community</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The primary difference between this option and the current IAOC
          arrangements is that board acts at a higher decision level, and is not
          involved either in detailed decisions. These are tasks reserved for the staff, and the
          board's role is to oversee that staff performs appropriately in their
          role.</t>

          <t>The composition of the board needs careful attention. It is important
          to have regular IETF participants in the board, but at least some of the
          board members need to have skills and experience less common among IETF
          participants, namely non-profit management, budget experience, and ability
          to help make connections to raise money or provide advice about
          fundraising (all of which are typical for a non-profit board).</t>

          <t>One potential model for populating the board is a Nomcom-selection for
          2/3 of the board members and some other type of selection for 1/3
          of the board members with a view for more independent, well-networked
          members. However, the responsibility of the board and the manner in which
          board members are selected are separable design matters.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="optionb" title="Strategic Board and an Advisory Council">

          <t>In this option, there is a board and staff just like in <xref
          target="optiona"/>, but in addition, an Advisory Council (AC) provides an
          interface to the community on matters that require assessing community
          opinion. For instance, the current polling of community feedback relating
          to potential future meeting locations could be one such matter.</t>

          <t>An advisory council canvassing and pulling for this information
          might be a better approach than either free-form mailing list discussion,
          or the relatively opaque process that is currently used. Advisory board
          results could be documented in the same fashion as IESG documents
          last call results. Some IAOC site decisions have been done in
          this way, summarising feedback received, others with less
	  information.</t>

          <t>The advisory council would be comprised of IETF community members and
          selected by Nomcom, and would benefit from having either the IETF Chair or
          another IESG member as a liaison. The advisory council would not make
          decisions about how the IETF should run, but it would be available for the
          staff to consult whenever they needed a view from the community, and it
          would also be available to run community discussion processes or to get
          input from the community to funnel back to the staff. The advisory council
          would have a well-defined interface to the IESG as well.</t>

          <t>The separation of the board and the advisory council, with some overlap
          between them, allows the allocation of people to tasks according to their
          skills. We can have experienced managers involved in hiring, firing, and
          reviewing the Executive Director and overseeing the budget, while we have
          experienced community people giving the perspective of the community.</t>

        </section>

      </section>
      <section anchor="staffresources" title="Staff Structure">

        <t>The design team believes that staff resources need to increase and/or
        be reorganised in order to move from one director to a few more specialised roles (see growth in
        <xref target="challenges"/>). And In addition, the team believes that future
        organisation for IASA may benefit from organising all resources under the more
        clear and direct control of the IETF (see division of
        responsibilities in <xref target="challenges"/> and roles in <xref
        target="goals"/>).</t>

        <t>The current arrangement involves one officially designated IASA employee,
        but there are also many supporting employees. They are less clearly assigned
        for the IETF, working as contractors or at ISOC.</t>

        <t>This document suggests a structure that involves the following roles:

        <list style="symbols">

          <t>Executive Director. The person in this role is in charge of the
          overall IASA effort, but can rely on other staff members below as well as
          contractors. The Executive Director is accountable to the Board.</t>

          <t>Director of Operations. This person is responsible for meeting
          arrangements, IT, tools, managing contracts (including RFC Editor and
          IANA), and day-to-day budget management.</t>

          <t>Director of Fundraising. This person is responsible for working with IETF's
          sponsors and other partners, and his or her primary responsibility
          is fundraising for the IETF.</t>

          <t>Director of Communications. This person is responsible for working with
          IETF leadership (including the IETF Chair, IESG, and IAB) on communications
          matters (primarily but not exclusively external communications),
          assisting them in efficient communication and dealing with
          ongoing communications matters.</t>

        </list></t>
        <t>Note: The Executive Director likely needs to be a full-time employee,
        as is likely the case for the other Director-level positions.</t>

	<t>These persons also need to rely on a number of contractors
	and outside specialists. For instance, a Legal Counsel, to assist the IASA on legal matters as well as contracting.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="funding" title="Funding">

	<t>This section discusses the overall changes to IETF funding sources, the level of
	funding, and how the level of funding is agreed with ISOC. And how the IETF
	can further develop its funding strategies over time.</t>

	<t>None of the adminstrative arrangements proposed in this document suggest that
	the fundamental funding arrangements change as a part of the reorganisation.
	ISOC will continue to support the IETF, though perhaps with
	means that provide better budgetary stability. There are also factors that affect
	the level of funding. Also, a better administrative organisation will be more
	capable of adjusting its strategies in the future in all areas, including
	funding. Any significant future changes require a capability of the IASA to
	focus on such strategic initiatives, which IASA 2.0 will help enable.</t>

	<t>It is important to ensure that IETF funding is arranged in a manner that is
	satisfactory to the IETF and ISOC communities. Any changes to arrangements are
	something that should be mutually agreed with both organisations. Further
	comments and observations are welcome.</t>

	<section title="One-time costs">

	  <t>There are one time costs associated with an administrative change, regardless of
	  which of the options discussed in this document are chosen. All the models in
	  the draft will have associated costs - e.g., to hire additional staff, cover
	  legal fees, etc.</t>

	  <t>Transition expenses should be considered separately from ongoing
	  expenses/funding needs. It should be noted that ISOC has promised to cover those
	  costs <xref target="Camarillo"/>.</t>

	</section>
	
	<section title="Funding Sources and Stability">

	  <t>The key sources of IETF funding are unlikely to radically change in
	  the short or medium term. This document suggests that ISOC continues as one of
	  our primary funding source, as it has been. Other primary sources of funding for
	  an organization like the IETF are well known, and we are already tapping into
	  all of the most common ones - corporations, individuals, and funds derived from
	  the registration of domain names. It is possible that we could develop
	  additional funding sources in the future (e.g., charitable foundations), but
	  those will require strategic planning and staffing, for which we need to get
	  IASA 2.0 in place first.</t>

	  <t>It's worth considering short-term (3-5 years) and long-term (5-10+ years) plans
	  differently. In the short term, we can continue to rely on our existing funding
	  sources regardless of which organizational model we end up with for IASA 2.0,
	  including the independent organization model. The role of ISOC as providing the
	  funding to the IETF and agreeing to help us if we get to trouble should stay
	  under all of the options, until or if a future funding model change changes
	  that.</t>

	  <t>While ISOC continues to support IETF financially as they
	  have previously, the different reorganisation options affect
	  the legal, contractual, and accounting related
	  details. While continuing as-is is possible, adopting a a
	  more stable and predicatable allocation of funding is
	  desirable (see <xref target="fundinglevel"/>, and in the
	  subsidiary and independent options formal contracts about
	  the funding are also necessary. The exact details of those
	  contracts and contracting parties are for further study, but 
	  they do not need to change the fundamental arrangement that 
	  is in place today.</t>

	  <t>More long-term, developing a sustainable funding plan for the IETF will be a
	  key project during the early months and years post-IASA 2.0. Ultimately a
	  healthier funding model will require raising more funds from the organizations
	  that benefit from IETF standards and whose employees participate in the IETF,
	  and may result in less reliance on ISOC funds. Such a model might incorporate
	  meeting-based sponsorships as we have traditionally had, other kinds of
	  sponsorships, a fully funded endowment, a different registration fee structure,
	  or other funding vehicles. But we are not in a position at present to develop
	  such a model and carry out the fundraising. We do not have sufficient staff,
	  skills, or resources to do it. We need to complete IASA 2.0 in order to be in a
	  position to do it. We are fortunate that we can rely on additional funds from
	  ISOC in the short term in order to bootstrap that process. As the old saying
	  goes, you have to spend money to make money.</t>
	  
	  <t>This isn't to say that the IETF not already considering how to make the funding
	  model more sustainable. The IAOC has new sponsorship staff this year, the
	  the IAOC sponsorship committee was recently chartered, and it has been discussing new ideas for raising
	  sponsorship funds. Changes to the present model will be adopted as those ideas
	  mature. IETF can cut some costs. But we can not expect
	  volunteers and folks working part-time on current fundraising targets to also
	  take on the additional substantial project of revamping the entire funding model
	  and having the additional funds show up on short order.</t>

	</section>
	
	<section anchor="fundinglevel" title="Funding level">

	  <t>Outside the discussion of sources, the level of funding has also been an issue.
	  The IETF is well supported by ISOC who have ultimately also been the backstop
	  when income has fallen below expectations. The IETF is also supported by a
	  number of other sponsors, whose significant contributions provide a big part of
	  the income.</t>

	  <t>However, at the same time there is an overall rising cost level that affects the
	  services IETF uses, there is community desire for supporting important new
	  services, technology that enables more participants to choose to participate
	  remotely, and industry pressures on optimising their costs. As the organisation
	  matures, and as more of the services that IETF provides come from professional
	  sources, it becomes more difficult to rely on significant fraction of any individual
	  volunteer time. This is visible, for instance, in our tools efforts, which have
	  become more commercially driven in the last years.</t>

	  <t>It is fair to say that IETF continues to be underfunded in the face of these
	  trends. In addition, IETF budgets have in recent years been relatively
	  optimistic. IETF is fortunate that ISOC has been there to provide a backstop
	  against surprises and the cost trends, but ideally, budgets should be realistic
	  and exceptions more exceptional than they are today.</t>

	  <t>To correct this, four things are needed:

	  <list style="numbers">

	    <t>Improve the accounting of IETF-related costs<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    The process that has gone on for several years to better reflect actual
	    IETF-related costs in the IETF (and ISOC) budget will continue, and depending on
	    the chosen model, reach a much more concrete and clear structure. This will not
	    as such, however, change the actual amount of expenditure
	    or income.
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    Note that the IETF already accounts for the expenses related to key IETF support
	    staff (e.g., IAD, communications, etc).</t>

	    <t>Implement a more realistic budgeting process.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    Assumptions about participant numbers, for instance, and the amount of
	    sponsorship available per meeting need to reflect reality better.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    This should also involve appropriate decisions about what services
	    are essential for the IETF community and which are not.<vspace blankLines="1"/>
	    
	    The improved budgeting processes have been a goal of the 2018
	    process, and need to be also going forward.</t>

	    <t>ISOC as a funder and backstop.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    ISOC continues to be the major IETF funding source, as well as the backstop
	    against emergencies. But a different arrangement regarding these two roles would
	    make the situation better manageable.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    Dedicated, realistically sufficient funds allocated to the IETF would allow the
	    normal operations to be run based on that, and would leave only true emergencies
	    such as cancellation of meetings due to local emergencies for the backstop.</t>

	    <t>Appropriate funding level.<vspace blankLines="1"/>

	    The IETF operations and funding level obviously need to
	    match. The specific level is, however, not related to the IASA 2.0
	    related organisational changes. Those organisatorial
	    changes only make it hopefully easier to manage both the
	    IETF operations and the funding.</t>

          <t>Note 1: Evolution in the current system is more difficult than if IETF was either clearly
          a subsidiary or its own organisation. This is because changes need agreement from two organisations,
	  and, in the current model, the control of IETF-dedicated resource is not as clear as it could be.
	  A subsidiary or independent model would also ease driving any strategy that the
          IETF wants to drive, as decisions would be more on the IETF side than something that
          today would require negotiation with ISOC.</t>

	  <t>Note 2: Setting expectations is difficult merely based on an
	  organisational model.  Certainly a clear separation between roles of the
	  board and staff helps. However, expectations are also a matter of
	  documentation, which would have be created and communicated. Finally,
	  expectations are a cultural matter, current IAOC arrangements and community
	  views have ended up in a situation where there is a lack of trust and unclear
	  models for what can or cannot be expected.</t>

        <t>Note 1: Given that the IASA is being reorganised, we
        acknowledge that the current structure is capable of evolving.
        However, the operational focus and overload in the current
        arrangements are making this harder than is necessary. Change
        requires action from outside of the IASA, rather than being a
        normal task within the IASA to evolve their own model. A
        strategic board that is not deeply involved in the operations
        should be able to look at evolution more easily. Similarly, a
        dedicated advisory council can help determine community
        concerns, and might be able to do this even better than a
        board. However, lines of authority between a strategic board
        and advisory council would need to be clearly delineated.</t>

        <t>Note 2: There may be a difference between the strategic board with and
        without an advisory council, in how overload situations and the separation of
        different tasks goes. The existence of an advisory council alleviates some workload on
        board or staff, particularly in dealing with community opinion determination, freeing the
        board to do its strategic work and staff to concentrate on operations and
        execution.</t>

        <t>Note 3: Setting expectations is difficult merely based on an
        oganisational model, see Note 2 under <xref
        target="comp-criteria-overall"/>.</t>

      <section title="Financial Impacts">

	<t>There are several different classes of financially-relevant changes.
	Funding-related changes have been covered in <xref target="funding"/>, as have transition
	costs.</t>

	<t>All the suggested models imply some actual increases in expenditure and
	financial resources on an ongoing basis. The following applies
	generally to all chosen models:</t>

	<t>The increases are due to, for instance, shifting
	more work to staff and contractors. For the staff changes, the primary position
	actually being added is having both Executive Director and Operations Director,
	instead of one IAD. We've already had a Legal Counsel and roles similar to the
	Director of Fundraising and Communications Director. These chances coincide with
	other personnel changes in IASA, as the experienced, long-term
	IAD is retiring and a long-term IETF Legal Counsel is also
	changing.</t>

	<t>It is also expected that the
	role of the Legal Counsel will also increase, e.g., in terms of reviewing
	contracts.</t>

	<t>For both the subsidiary model or the independent
	orginisation model, there can be additional and potentially
	significant costs. For example, having a full-time
	communications director on staff means paying the person's
	full salary, health insurance, worker's compensation, sick
	pay, etc. In general, while under the ISOC model the IETF may
	have been able to take a particular percentage of a person's
	base costs, under a more independent arrangements the IETF
	is an employer and liable for all associated costs at 100%.
	Similarly, some current contracted or volunteer roles, if
	turned to staff positions, can increase costs.</t>

	<t>Audits, payroll, HR, office space, equipment - these are things we do
	not currently account for in the IETF budget, that we wouldn't have to
	pay for as a subsidiary (assuming we can share overhead with ISOC,
	since that's part of the point), but that we would have to pay for as
	an independent org.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Other Impacts">

        <t>Depending on the chosen option, volunteers are needed for either different roles than
        today (the board) or for both different roles and more volunteers (the board and the
        advisory council).</t>

        <t>It is for further study whether current IETF leadership (e.g., IAB Chair) should
        continue to be part of these boards or councils.</t>

    <section title="Conclusions and Recommendations" anchor="conc_recs">

      <t>While there are some initial conclusions in the analysis in the previous
      sections, clearly more work is needed. In particular, we request and welcome thoughts and contributions
      from the IETF community, particularly regarding any potential missed
      options or the implications of options being considered here.</t>
	    
	    <t>Nevertheless, rather than leave all options open for consideration by the community, and 
		    given the considerable time  that the IASA 2.0 Design Team has spend studying these 
	    options, we would particularly like feedback on the draft recommendations below.</t>

	    <section title="Draft Recommendations">

	      <t>The design team recommends the following:
	      
      		<list style="symbols">
		<t>Structure: ISOC Subsidiary. This preserves our longstanding and beneficial association with ISOC but takes 
			important steps to better define roles and responsibilities, creates greater independence for the IETF under  
			the ISOC umbrella, and can put the IETF on a path towards greater self-sufficiency.</t>
        	<t>Composition of Board: Board of 9 people (odd number preferred). Assuming a board of 9, then 
			3 members to be selected via the IETF NomCom, 3 members to be selected by the board itself, and 3 members to 
			be selected by ISOC. Selections would be confirmed by the IAB, or perhaps the IESG. Board members 
			would serve for 2 or 3 year terms, and may be term-limited to no more than two or three consecutive terms. 
			An objective is to confidence that there is IETF oversight but also lets the board select people who 
			bring necessary business skills and independence, and thus may be unknown to or less known to the IETF (and 
			for which the IETF NomCom may be unequipped to assess given their technical backgrounds and focus on 
			selecting primarily for technical skill sets).</t>
		<t>Staffing: Between IETF-100 and IETF-101, document each specific staff and/or contractor role and map out all 
			responsibilities.</t>
		<t>Long-Term Funding: The current level of annual funding from ISOC fluctuates from year-to-year. We propose 
			creating more funding certainly in one of two potential ways, which need further discussion with ISOC. 
			The first option is to agree on a percentage of ISOC revenue. The second option is to increase IETF funding 
			to roughly a new flat amount above which IETF has historically received, indexed to rise with inflation 
			annually. The objective of either option is to provide a more predictable revenue base with which the 
			IETF can perform better long-term planning. ISOC should also commit to remain in their role as a 
			financial backstop for any potential one-time issues (such a meeting cancelation due to a natural 
			disaster).</t>
		<t>IETF Endowment: Either via a new long-term funding agreement with ISOC or as a standalone matter, 
			we believe a 10-year plan to fully fund the IETF endowment should be a key objective. Once full 
			funding is received, then theoretically the income from the endowment could provide funding for most or 
			perhaps even all of the IETF's operating expenses, should ISOC suffer a decline in their primary revenue 
			source (which is from PIR, from .ORG domain name registrations).</t>
      		</list></t>

    	   </section>
	    
	    <section title="Transition Plan" anchor="transition">

		    <t>Following feedback we receive before and during the IETF-100 meeting, we will develop a detailed transition 
		    plan and include that here. We can then seek feedback on the transition plan between the 100th and 101st IETF 
		    meetings, with the goal of an actionable recommendation for how to effect the transition presented at IETF-101.</t>
		    
		    <t>The transition plan should address items such as the following (and we seek suggestions on areas we may have 
		    missed):<list style="symbols">
        				<t>Volunteer organisational transition plan and timeframe</t>
        				<t>Legal, financial, and administrative actions</t>
        				<t>Staffing actions (e.g. job descriptions)</t>
		    			<t>Documentation actions (e.g. roles and responsibilities, updates to RFCs)</t>
		    			<t>Near-term goals for the new board (e.g. develop and release a budget within 90 
						days of formation)</t>
					<t>Other</t>
