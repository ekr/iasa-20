    <abstract>
      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF were
      created more than ten years ago. Since then, there has been considerable change in the
      tasks and in our own expectations. The IETF community has
      discussed these changes and the problems they cause. The community has
      some sense of the properties they expect from future arrangements,
      including structural and organizational changes, changes to volunteer and
      staff personnel resources, and transparency changes.</t>

      <t>This document is a product of a design team, focused on providing
      additional information to the community about solution options, as well as
      supporting analysis of the implications of those options.  To be clear,
      the community is responsible for adopting any recommendations or making any final
      decisions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF
      (referred to as the "IETF Administrative Support Activity" (IASA) <xref target="RFC4071"/>) were created more than ten years ago,
      when the IETF initially took charge of its own administration. The
      arrangements have served the IETF reasonably well, but there's been considerable
      change in the necessary tasks, in the world around us, and our own
      expectations since the creation of the IASA. What administrative arrangements
      best support the IETF in the next ten years?</t>

      <t>The system has experienced various challenges and frustrations along the
      way, for instance around meeting arrangements. There are also some bigger
      questions about how the organisations are structured, for instance about the
      division of responsibilities between IETF and ISOC.</t>

      <t>The IETF community has discussed and continues to discuss these topics, most
      recently on the "IASA20" mailing list and BOF at IETF98. Alissa Cooper, the
      Chair of the IETF, convened a small design team to start evaluating potential
      options going forward. The purpose of the design team is to provide material
      that informs the community discussion, both in terms of providing a bit more
      worked through solution ideas, as well as supporting analysis of the implications
      of those options. This information, along with all other input provided in the
      discussion, hopefully helps the community and IETF leadership decide what next
      steps to take.</t>

      <t>To be clear, the community is in charge of adopting any recommendations
      or making any decisions. This draft, the output of the design team's
      considerations, has no particular official standing.</t>

      <t>Once an initial version of this draft is published, the authors
      would like to ask feedback particularly on two aspects:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>If the set of options outlined in the draft covers the
        options that should be looked at.</t>
        <t>If the analysis of the implications of the options is
        correct.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Once this discussion completes, it becomes feasible to discuss what the
      conclusions or recommendations ought to be, and which recommendations the
      community should adopt. It should also be noted that IETF administrative
      matters have been organised jointly with ISOC, and it is important that
      ISOC be involved in the process of looking at the reorganisation.</t>

      <t>As a base for this work there was a good articulation of the set of problems we
      are facing in <xref target="I-D.hall-iasa20-workshops-report"/> and
      <xref target="I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective"/>. The community discussion
      seems have indicated also some of the outcome properties that are expected.
      The scope of the solutions explored included:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Structural and organizational changes, both externally (with ISOC and contractors)
        and internally (within the IAOC and subcommittees)</t>
        <t>Changes to personnel resources, both volunteer and paid</t>
        <t>Transparency changes</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Changes to the funding model are out of scope to the extent they fall outside the
      categories above.</t>

      <t>The rest of the document is organised as follows. The next two sections (<xref target="background" /> and <xref target="challenges" />) describe
      the background and summarise the challenges noted in the community discussion.
      The two sections after that (<xref target="consider_change" /> and <xref target="reorg_options" />) explain what categories of changes were considered,
      and describe the primary options for structural changes. The following two sections (<xref target="analysis" /> and <xref target="conc_recs" />) focus on analysis of the different
      options along with conclusions and recommendations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Background" anchor="background">

      <t>The administrative support structure is intended to be responsive to the administrative
      needs of the IETF technical community.</t>

      <t>RFC 4071 <xref target="RFC4071" /> defines the current IETF Administrative Support
      Activity (IASA). It is an activity housed within the Internet Society (ISOC), as is
      the rest of the IETF.  RFC 4071 defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), the IETF Administrative Director (IAD),
      and ISOC in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.
      It also defines the membership and selection rules for the IAOC.</t>

      <t>As RFC 4071 notes, IASA is distinct from IETF-related technical functions, such
      as the RFC Editor, the IANA, and the IETF standards process itself.  The IASA has
      no influence on the technical decisions of the IETF or on the technical contents
      of IETF work.</t>

      <t>Today, IASA's activities support a number of functions within the IETF system:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Meeting planning</t>
	<t>Budget and financial management</t>
        <t>Contracting with and overseeing the secretariat</t>
        <t>Contracting with and overseeing the RFC Editor (together with the IAB)</t>
        <t>Contracting with and overseeing IANA (together with the IAB)</t>
        <t>Legal ownership of IETF materials, domain names and copyright</t>
        <t>Ownership of IANA-related domain names and copyright</t>
	<t>General legal support (including topics beyond domains and IPR)</t>
        <t>IETF website</t>
        <t>IETF IT services</t>
        <t>Tooling support, maintenance, and development (together with volunteers)</t>
        <t>Meeting network support</t>
        <t>Remote attendance support</t>
        <t>Communications assistance for the IETF</t>
        <t>Sponsorship and funding (together with ISOC)</t>
      </list></t>

      <section title="Terminology"  anchor="terms">

        <t>The following acronyms are used in this document:

        <list style="symbols">

          <t>IASA - IETF Administrative Support Activity - An organized activity that
	  provides administrative support for the IETF, the IAB and the IESG.</t>

          <t>IAOC - IETF Administrative Oversight Committee in the current IASA system - A largely
          IETF-selected committee that oversees and directs IASA.  Accountable to the IETF
          community.</t>

          <t>IAOC committees - Recognizing the need for specialized attention for different
          branches of work requiring IAOC oversight, the IAOC expanded its support by creating
          committees. Currently, the committees do the heavy lifting on specific tasks, while
          the IAOC is the one responsible for final decisions.</t>

          <t>ISOC - The Internet Society - The organizational home of the IETF, and one that in the
          current IASA system assists the IETF with legal, administrative, and funding tasks.</t>

          <t>IAD - IETF Administrative Director - In the current system, the sole staff member
          responsible for carrying out the work of the IASA.  An ISOC employee.</t>

          <t>IETF Trust - In the current system the IETF Trust acquires, maintains, and licenses
          intellectual and other property used in connection with the administration of the IETF.
          Same composition as IAOC.</t>

    <section anchor="challenges" title="Challenges">

      <t>Discussion leading to this document has been framed by the issues discussed on IETF
      mailing lists and documented elsewhere  <xref target="I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective"/>,
      <xref target="I-D.hall-iasa20-workshops-report"/>,
      <xref target="I-D.arkko-ietf-iasa-thoughts"/>.  The reader is referred to those
      documents and ongoing discussion on the IASA20@ietf.org mailing list for fuller
      details on the range of challenges facing the IETF in its handling of administrative
      matters.</t>

      <t>In summary, the key areas of challenge that have shaped this work are:

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>The range of IETF administrative tasks have grown considerably; we must ensure that we
        have the right structure, community involvement and level of staffing to
        address them effectively and efficiently.</t>

        <t>The relationship and division of responsibilities between the IETF and ISOC have changed,
        as both organizations have grown considerably in the last decade.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        The joint organisation that supports the IETF has grown rather organically, and
        would benefit from re-assessment and possible reorganisation.
        </t>

        <t>Community expectations of transparency of administrative actions
        and execution from the administration could be better aligned.</t>

        <t>Lack of predictably of funding levels combined with regular shortfalls.
	<vspace blankLines="1"/>

        We face continued challenges related to funding IETF activities on a background of
	increasing costs. We must properly manage expectations about locations of meetings
        (broadening of IETF engagement, sponsor preferences) while balancing against
        operational practicalities.  And we must ensure that we continue to not be influenced by
        funding entities on the technical work of the IETF.</t>

      </list></t>

      <t>Of the items above, the first two are largely to be addressed by structural
      updates, while the last two groups are more about discussing tradeoffs and
      updating documented expectations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Considering a Change" anchor="consider_change">

      <t>Given that a change seems necessary, what might that change include? There
      seem to be three broad categories of IETF organisation that will be affected:

      <list style="numbers">
        <t>overall structure</t>
        <t>oversight</t>
        <t>interfaces and expectations to rest of the IETF</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>The overall structure also includes questions such as whether IETF is an organisation and its relationship to ISOC.</t>

      <t>There are some interconnections between different aspects of
      reorganisation. For instance, how IETF defines its relationship to ISOC will
      have some implications on what kind of oversight structure is needed;
      a more independent, free-standing organisational model for IETF
      would imply new functions for the IASA.</t>

      <t>There are a number of choices to make within the reorganisation effort. In particular,
      IETF's relationship to ISOC could be arranged in a fundamentally similar manner than
      it is today, but improved, e.g., to make clear who is expected to control a particular
      part of the operation. But the relationship could also be arranged in a different way,
      for instance, as a subsidiary of ISOC or as a more free-standing, independent organisational
      unit.</t>

      <section anchor="problemstmt" title="Problem Statement">

	<t>The purpose of this part of the document is to describe a
	few problem areas with enough detail to allow the comparison
	of potential IASA structure updates (among themselves, as well
	as comparison to the status quo). This is intentionally
	illustrative, rather than an exhaustive enumeration of all
	possible and perceived issues with the current structure and
	implementation. Nevertheless, the examples are concrete and
	real.  (For a fuller description of the perceived issues with
	the current IASA arrangements, see TBD).</t>

	<section title="Lack of Clarity">

	  <t>In general, as the IETF has grown and aged, an increasing
	  lack of clarity exists in a number of specific areas. We
	  discuss four areas where this lack of clarity is
	  specifically acute: responsibility, representation,
	  authority, and oversight.</t>

	  <section title="Responsibility">

	    <t>The line between the IETF and ISOC is not
	    organizationally clear-cut, which has led to issues around
	    transparency, allocation of staff time and priorities,
	    budgeting, and clarity of who is responsible for what.</t>

	    <t>Often, in can be unclear what part of the IETF or ISOC
	    is responsible for a particular function. Things as simple
	    as ensuring there is a lanyard sponsor/coordinator, but
	    also functions as important as fundraising and sponsorship
	    development can suffer from a lack of clear
	    responsibility.</t>

	  </section>

	  <section title="Representation">

	    <t>The respective roles of ISOC, the IETF chair, the IAOC,
	    and the secretariat in representing the IETF to sponsors
	    and donors and communicating with them are not clear.</t>

	    <t>Having ISOC represent the IETF to sponsors and donors:

	    <list style="symbols">
	      <t>creates confusion about why the IETF does not
	      represent itself,</t>
	      <t>yields questions about why ISOC does not instead
	      increase its IETF support and how donations can be
	      guaranteed to be dedicated to the IETF, and</t>
	      <t>can result in those soliciting sponsorships and
	      donations having a lack of familiarity with IETF
	      work.</t>
	    </list>
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Authority">
	    <t>Another significant problem concerns authority, and to
	    what extent can IETF make decisions on its own in the
	    current structure compared to decisions that require ISOC
	    approval and agreement.</t>

	    <t>Example: Due to IETF's lack of legal status,
	    contractual agreements must be signed by ISOC on behalf of
	    the IETF.  There are occasions when a decision that is
	    right for the IETF and desired by IETF leadership cannot
	    be executed due to constraints posed by what ISOC can and
	    cannot agree to itself. For example, when IETF sought to
	    acquire a recent piece of software for business purposes,
	    ISOC would initially not agree to entering into an
	    agreement with the software provider. Ideally, IETF could
	    make decisions free from operational and other constraints
	    imposed by its relationship with ISOC.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Oversight">
	    <t>The IAOC is the primary oversight body in the current
	    IASA model, but there can be confusion or mismatches in
	    roles. For example, the IAOC has an administrative staffer
	    that is an ISOC employee, but does this role ultimately
	    report to the IAOC committe, the IAD, or ISOC staff?</t>
	  </section>

	</section>

	<section title="Lack of Resources">
	  <t>IETF faces growing constraints on resources essential for
	  IETF to function, notably in volunteers, staff, and
	  time.</t>

	  <section title="Volunteers">
	    <t>As the IAD is the sole FTE for IETF, naturally the IASA
	    arrangement has evolved to encompass a series of volunteer
	    committees that help to work through issues such as
	    finance, legal, meetings, technology management, requests
	    for proposals, and sponsorship.  Volunteers have limited
	    time and specific interests and there does not ever seem
	    to be enough volunteers to effectively populate these
	    committees.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Staff">
	    <t>IETF faces serious constraints on staff capacity under
	    the current IASA model. The one IAD role and support from
	    contractors have been used to assure that capacity needed
	    is for the most part in place. However, it seems clear
	    that the IAD role is overly complex and taxing for a
	    single human at this point, necessitating measures such as
	    providing an administrator for the IAOC to better run that
	    body and their meetings.</t>
	  </section>

	  <section title="Time">
	    <t>(JLH: Not sure what to highlight here.)</t>
	  </section>

	</section>

	<section title="Lack of Transparency">
	  <t>IAOC has typically been perceived to operate less
	  transparently than what is the norm for IETF processes and
	  other IETF leadership bodies.</t>

	  <t>Lack of transparency has some roots in concerns about
	  confidentiality of contract terms and business
	  relationships, and fear of community reaction to
	  administrative decisions.</t>

	  <t>Requirements from the community about IAOC transparency
	  expectations are not clear.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Funding/Operating Model Mismatch and Rising Costs">

	  <t>Meeting fees are currently an important source of
	  revenue, but remote participation and other factors may be
	  responsible for declining in-person meeting attendance going
	  forward.  Even if fees were charged for remote
	  participation, charging the same for remote and in-person
	  attendance is unlikely to be a viable way to make up the
	  difference.</t>

	  <t>While there has been a lot of sponsor support for, e.g.,
	  meeting hosting, getting support for the full sponsorship
	  program is not easy.  The value to sponsors is not always
	  obvious, the IETF community is sometimes critical or
	  unappreciative, and the same sponsors get tapped again and
	  again for many related but different opportunities.</t>

	  <t>Relying heavily on meeting-based revenue is somewhat at
	  odds with the fact that much of the IETF's work takes place
	  outside of in- person meetings.</t>

	  <t>The IETF is increasingly relying on professional services
	  to support its activities, causing expenses to grow.</t>
	</section>
      </section>
      
      <section anchor="goals" title="Goals">

        <t>The IASA redesign effort needs to address the main challenges listed above. More
        specifically, a new organisational structure needs to do at least the following:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Protect the IETF's Culture & Technical Work: Ensure that future IASA organizational structure and 
		  processes preserves and protects
          the IETF's unique culture of individual contribution, clear separation of financial
          support from technical work, as well as rough consensus and running code.</t>
		
		<t>Improve the IETF's Technical Environment: Undertake changes to better enable technical contributors to focus more
		on that work and less on administrative work or support activities. (NOTE: THIS IS NOT A FULLY FORMED THOUGHT 
		AND THUS NOT ESPECIALLY WELL ARTICULATED AS OF YET)</t>
		
		<t>Define a New IETF-ISOC Relationship: Define the roles of IETF and ISOC in a way that helps the above structure be '
			as clear
          as possible, in terms of who does what, how are things accounted for, and who is in charge
		  of adjustments and control (e.g., staff resources). This also includes consideration of a new funding model and
		the historical responsibility for the IETF that ISOC has always had.</t>
		  
		<t>Clarify Overall Roles & Respos</t>
		
		<t>Define a New Long-Term Funding Model: A redesign needs to propose a starting point for the
          financial arrangements between IETF and ISOC, either as they are now or changed in
          some fashion. It must also be clear to people outside the IETF and ISOC organisation
          (e.g., sponsors) what the arrangements are and what their contributions affect and
          do not affect.</t>


          <t>Define Support Staff Roles & Responsibilities: Define the roles of the oversight entities and staff/contractors to 
		  match the grown
          size of the tasks. Ensure that we have a structure that can adapt to future growth and
          other changes.</t>

          <t>Re-define the Role of the IETF Community in Relation to Administrative Activities: Accommodate strategic, operational, 
		  and execution tasks within the administrative
	  efforts, and take into account the limited availability of IETF volunteers
          for performing administrative tasks. The new design needs to ensure that overload in such things
          as operational decisions does not affect the ability to drive strategic changes. Focus on the lines between responsibility, representation,
	  authority, and oversight.</t>

          <t>Define Transparency Requirememts from IETF Administration to the IETF Community: Set expectations and limits of those expectations on the different parts of the system.
          This includes but is not limited to community expectations of transparency.</t>

		<t>Define a New IAOC/IASA Team: Determine what structure we need and determine a transition plan.</t>

    <section title="Reorganisation Options" anchor="reorg_options">

      <section title="Overall Structure">

        <t>The design team believes that there
        are three general approaches to evolving the IASA function. The options
        generally focus on the relationship between the IETF and ISOC. Changes to
        this relationship directly affect how the IASA function gets carried out.</t>

	<t>It
        should be noted that all three options require more administrative budget
        per year than what is currently allocated for IASA functions. In addition,
        they will most likely require a more predictable level of ISOC funding,
        rather than the current model of a base funding level combined with
        periodic infusions to cover shortfalls.</t>

        <t>The following
        subsections describe each option. <xref target="analysis"/> highlights their
        pros and cons and effectiveness in comparison to the goals stated
        earlier.</t>

        <section title="IASA++">

          <t>In the IASA++ option, the IETF and ISOC maintain the current structural
          relationship.  This means that the IETF remains an organized activity of
          ISOC, ISOC maintains funds and contracting authority on behalf of the
          IETF, and all IASA staff are ISOC employees.</t>

          <t>While the relationship remains the same, the IETF and ISOC will make
          improvements to the relationship in order to enhance the functionality of the
          IETF. The following are some potential improvements that could be made under
          this approach:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Provide clarity and transparency about authority, responsibility,
            budgeting, and allocation of staff time for all IETF-related work and
            activities.</t>
            <t>Add IASA staff to better reflect the increased workload on what is
            now a single staff member.</t>
            <t>Provide clarity about authority of the IAOC in reviewing performance
            of IASA staff.</t>
            <t>Re-structure the internal IETF organization and appointment processes
            for the IAOC and the IETF Trust to address current challenges.</t>
            <t>Establish IETF community consensus about who has policy authority for
            administrative decisions where there is currently a lack of clarity.</t>
	  </list></t>

          <t>The key focus in implementing this option would be sorting out the roles
          and responsiblities of the IAOC and ISOC. The IETF needs to be able to make
          its own administrative decisions independent of ISOC. Having a concrete
          separation of roles and responsibilities will allow each organization to
          develop their own internal policies that meet their different operational
          needs. It should be noted that the IETF needs to keep abreast of changes to
          ISOC policies to ensure that the working arrangement remains smooth. Some
          examples of where the IAOC needs autonomy from ISOC policies include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Contract administration</t>
            <t>Spending authority limits</t>
            <t>Personnel decisions, including compensation</t>
          </list></t>

	  <t>Some specific changes to make these improvements are discussed in
	  <xref target="oversight"/> regarding board and staff work divisions.
	  While in this option there is no need for a formal board, there is
	  still a need to redefine the role of the IAOC. The necessary
	  staff changes are discussed in <xref target="staffresources"/>.</t>

	  <t>It would also be necessary to improve IAOC transparency. In the IASA++ option,
	  in addition to the general improvement needs in this area, there is an added need
	  to continue the improvements relating to accurate accounting of resources
	  and actions on the ISOC side. This relates directly to the delineation of roles
          and responsibilities necessary for the IAOC to operate independent of ISOC. Improved
          transparency will allow the IETF community to be more aware of IAOC operations and
          decisions. Such changes to the IAOC will require changes to <xref target="RFC4071" />.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="option2" title="ISOC Subsidiary">

          <t>In this option, an ISOC subsidiary would be created as the new legal
          home of the IETF.  A subsidiary can have its own bank account, by-laws,
          charter, board of directors/trustees, staff, and corporate identity. As a
          subsidiary of ISOC, the IETF and ISOC can share overhead and
          resources. The IETF would likely rely heavily on contractors for most
          administrative tasks.</t>

          <t>As a subsidiary of ISOC, the IETF could eliminate the IAOC and replace
          it with a board of directors/trustees (see <xref target="oversight"/>).
	  Administrative decision-making
          authority would rest primarily with the administrative staff, with oversight
          provided by the board (see <xref target="staffresources"/>.
	  Exception cases could be developed where board
          approval would be required to authorize strategic decisions.</t>

          <t>Other likely changes could include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Transfer existing IETF-related contracts between ISOC and contractors
            to be between the subsidiary and contractors.</t>
            <t>Multiple options to structure community involvement in administrative
            decision-making (e.g., committees organized by subsidiary staff).</t>
          </list></t>

	  <t>There are also other possible changes that would need further
	  discussion:

	  <list style="symbols">
            <t>Eliminate the IETF Trust and have the IETF subsidiary assume
            responsibility for the IETF's intellectual property rights (IPR). This
	    would simplify the overall structure, but would also bundle the IPR with 
	    the rest of the IETF operations. Note that the IETF Trust currently holds IPR also on
	    behalf of the users of IANA.</t>
            <t>Transfer existing ISOC funds earmarked for the IETF to the subsidiary's
            bank account, and have future IETF income held in that subsidiary's bank
            account.</t>
          </list></t>

        </section>

        <section title="Independent Organization">

          <t>In this option, a new non-profit organization (e.g., IETForg) is
          created independent from ISOC as the new legal home of the IETF. IETForg
          would have its own bank account, by-laws, charter, board of
          directors/trustees, staff, and corporate identity. The administrative
          staff for IETForg could be kept lean and would likely rely on contractors for the
          bulk of administrative tasks. Minimally, the IETForg staff would be
          responsible for administration, development/fundraising, communications,
          and personnel management.</t>

          <t>As an independent organization, the IETF could eliminate the IAOC and
          replace it with a board of directors/trustees. Administrative (day-to-day) decision-making
          authority would rest primarily with IETForg staff and contractors, with oversight
          provided by the board. Exception cases could be developed where board
          approval would be required to authorize strategic decisions. Again, further
	  detais regarding the board and staff changes are in <xref target="oversight"/> 
	  and <xref target="staffresources"/>.</t>

          <t>Other likely changes could include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Transfer existing ISOC funds earmarked for the IETF to IETForg, and
            have future IETF income held by IETForg. ISOC would still be largest
            IETForg sponsor, if funding is maintained at current projections.</t>
            <t>Transfer existing IETF-related contracts between ISOC and contractors
            to be between IETForg and contractors.</t>
            <t>Multiple options to structure community involvement in administrative
            decision-making (e.g., committees organized by subsidiary staff).</t>
          </list></t>
	  
          <t>Other possible changes that may need more discussion would
          include possible change in the role of IETF Trust, as
          discussed in <xref target="option2"/>.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="oversight" title="Oversight">

        <t>Oversight is obviously affected by what we decide to do with the
        relationship to ISOC. A bigger, more independent role for the IETF would
        require an IASA board to be designed for that. Nevertheless,
	some change in the role of an oversight body and the work division
	between it and staff is necessary in any case.</t>

        <t>Also, the design team believes the role of the community members serving in the
        IASA needs to be kept at a level appropriate for volunteer service (see
        community role in <xref target="challenges"/> and limits in <xref
        target="goals"/>).</t>

        <t>Beyond this, there are a number of choices in division of
        responsibilities and the structure of the organisation. The key decision
        points are:

        <list style="symbols">

          <t>Whether the community representative or board control of the IASA is at the
          level of individual administrative decisions (as it is today) or at a more
          traditional board level of control, i.e., strategic direction, budgets, and key
          personnel choices.</t>

          <t>Whether the interface to the community is via staff or a community
          representative or board function.</t>

        </list></t>

        <section anchor="optiona" title="Strategic Board">

          <t>In this option, the current IAOC is disbanded and replaced by a
          traditional oversight board, common in most non-profit organisations. This
          board, the IASA Board (IB), acts to set strategic direction for IETF
          administrative matters, sets budgets, provides fiscal oversight, provides
          high-level oversight about major new projects, and so on. The board is also
          responsible for hiring and assessing the performance of the Executive
          Director (the highest-level staff director, see <xref
          target="staffresources"/>).</t>

	  <t>This option is potentially valid for all overall structure choices
	  outlined in <xref target="reorg_options"/>. However, for the ISOC Subsidiary and
	  Independent Organisation options, the board would have to be a formal
	  board, typical of other non-profit organisations.</t>

          <t>The board works with staff who is empowered to carry out the operations
          as directed by the board. The staff is responsible for operating within
          the limits set by the board, and are accountable to the board. Including
          being hired and fired as needed. The staff's responsibilities include:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>preparing for and making decisions on their agreed and budgeted areas
            (for example, meeting venue decisions)</t>
            <t>operational execution of these decisions, including contracting with
            vendors</t>
            <t>communicating with the community</t>
            <t>development of the IETF's administrative operation, in consultation
            with the community</t>
          </list></t>

          <t>The primary difference between this option and the current IAOC
          arrangements is that board acts at a higher decision level, and is not
          involved either in detailed decisions. These are tasks reserved for the staff, and the
          board's role is to oversee that staff performs appropriately in their
          role.</t>

          <t>The composition of the board needs careful attention. It is important
          to have regular IETF participants in the board, but at least some of the
          board members need to have skills and experience less common among IETF
          participants, namely non-profit management, budget experience, and ability
          to help make connections to raise money or provide advice about
          fundraising (all of which are typical for a non-profit board).</t>

          <t>One potential model for populating the board is a Nomcom-selection for
          2/3 of the board members and some other type of selection for 1/3
          of the board members with a view for more independent, well-networked
          members. However, the responsibility of the board and the manner in which
          board members are selected are separable design matters.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="optionb" title="Strategic Board and an Advisory Council">

          <t>In this option, there is a board and staff just like in <xref
          target="optiona"/>, but in addition, an Advisory Council (AC) provides an
          interface to the community on matters that require assessing community
          opinion. For instance, the current polling of community feedback relating
          to potential future meeting locations could be one such matter.</t>

          <t>An advisory council canvassing and pulling for this information
          might be a better approach than either free-form mailing list discussion,
          or the relatively opaque process that is currently used. Advisory board
          results could be documented in the same fashion as IESG documents
          last call results. Some IAOC site decisions have been done in
          this way, summarising feedback received, others with less
	  information.</t>

          <t>The advisory council would be comprised of IETF community members and
          selected by Nomcom, and would benefit from having either the IETF Chair or
          another IESG member as a liaison. The advisory council would not make
          decisions about how the IETF should run, but it would be available for the
          staff to consult whenever they needed a view from the community, and it
          would also be available to run community discussion processes or to get
          input from the community to funnel back to the staff. The advisory council
          would have a well-defined interface to the IESG as well.</t>

          <t>The separation of the board and the advisory council, with some overlap
          between them, allows the allocation of people to tasks according to their
          skills. We can have experienced managers involved in hiring, firing, and
          reviewing the Executive Director and overseeing the budget, while we have
          experienced community people giving the perspective of the community.</t>

        </section>

      </section>
      <section anchor="staffresources" title="Staff Structure">

        <t>The design team believes that staff resources need to increase and/or
        be reorganised in order to move from one director to a few more specialised roles (see growth in
        <xref target="challenges"/>). And In addition, the team believes that future
        organisation for IASA may benefit from organising all resources under the more
        clear and direct control of the IETF (see division of
        responsibilities in <xref target="challenges"/> and roles in <xref
        target="goals"/>).</t>

        <t>The current arrangement involves one officially designated IASA employee,
        but there are also many supporting employees. They are less clearly assigned
        for the IETF, working as contractors or at ISOC.</t>

        <t>This document suggests a structure that involves the following roles:

        <list style="symbols">

          <t>Executive Director. The person in this role is in charge of the
          overall IASA effort, but can rely on other staff members below as well as
          contractors. The Executive Director is accountable to the Board.</t>

          <t>Director of Operations. This person is responsible for meeting
          arrangements, IT, tools, managing contracts (including RFC Editor and
          IANA), and day-to-day budget management.</t>

          <t>Director of Fundraising. This person is responsible for working with IETF's
          sponsors and other partners, and his or her primary responsibility
          is fundraising for the IETF.</t>

          <t>Director of Communications. This person is responsible for working with
          IETF leadership (including the IETF Chair, IESG, and IAB) on communications
          matters (primarily but not exclusively external communications),
          assisting them in efficient communication and dealing with
          ongoing communications matters.</t>

        </list></t>
        <t>Note: The Executive Director likely needs to be a full-time employee,
        as is likely the case for the other Director-level positions.</t>

	<t>These persons also need to rely on a number of contractors
	and outside specialists. For instance, a Legal Counsel, to assist the IASA on legal matters as well as contracting.</t>

          <t>Note 1: Evolution in the current system is more difficult than if IETF was either clearly
          a subsidiary or its own organisation. This is because changes need agreement from two organisations,
	  and, in the current model, the control of IETF-dedicated resource is not as clear as it could be.
	  A subsidiary or independent model would also ease driving any strategy that the
          IETF wants to drive, as decisions would be more on the IETF side than something that
          today would require negotiation with ISOC.</t>

	  <t>Note 2: Setting expectations is difficult merely based on an
	  organisational model.  Certainly a clear separation between roles of the
	  board and staff helps. However, expectations are also a matter of
	  documentation, which would have be created and communicated. Finally,
	  expectations are a cultural matter, current IAOC arrangements and community
	  views have ended up in a situation where there is a lack of trust and unclear
	  models for what can or cannot be expected.</t>

        <t>Note 1: Given that the IASA is being reorganised, we
        acknowledge that the current structure is capable of evolving.
        However, the operational focus and overload in the current
        arrangements are making this harder than is necessary. Change
        requires action from outside of the IASA, rather than being a
        normal task within the IASA to evolve their own model. A
        strategic board that is not deeply involved in the operations
        should be able to look at evolution more easily. Similarly, a
        dedicated advisory council can help determine community
        concerns, and might be able to do this even better than a
        board. However, lines of authority between a strategic board
        and advisory council would need to be clearly delineated.</t>

        <t>Note 2: There may be a difference between the strategic board with and
        without an advisory council, in how overload situations and the separation of
        different tasks goes. The existence of an advisory council alleviates some workload on
        board or staff, particularly in dealing with community opinion determination, freeing the
        board to do its strategic work and staff to concentrate on operations and
        execution.</t>

        <t>Note 3: Setting expectations is difficult merely based on an
        oganisational model, see Note 2 under <xref
        target="comp-criteria-overall"/>.</t>

      <section title="Financial Impacts">

        <t>There are two different classes of financially-relevant changes. First, both the ISOC interface change and
        staff changes will imply changes in what is being accounted for in budgets and reports,
        even in cases where the actual work or the number of people stays the same. That is,
	depending on the chosen overall organisation model, some items that are currently in ISOC budget
	may move to become IETF budget items, but the total amount of expenditure stays the same. Note that the
	IETF already accounts for the expenses related to key IETF support staff (e.g., IAD, communications, etc).</t>

	<t>Secondly,there are some actual increases in required financial resources.
        We expect all the alternatives to lead to somewhat higher
        funding needs, and in fact shifting more work to staff from
        volunteers is one of the goals. For the staff changes,
        the primary position actually being added is
        having both Executive Director and Operations Director,
        instead of one IAD. We've already had a Legal Counsel and
        roles similar to the Director of Fundraising and
        Communications Director. These chances coincide with other
        personnel changes in IASA, as the experienced, long-term IAD
        is retiring. Even from a learning curve point of view more
        people will be needed, but in this case it also makes sense to
        have the organisation be less dependent on one central
        person.</t>

        <t>Given the learning curve effect, and a new organisation, it is expected that the role
        of the Legal Counsel will also increase, e.g., in terms of reviewing contracts.</t>

	<t>It is important to ensure that IETF funding is arranged in
	a manner that is satisfactory to the IETF and ISOC
	communities. Further comments and observations are welcome.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Other Impacts">

        <t>Depending on the chosen option, volunteers are needed for either different roles than
        today (the board) or for both different roles and more volunteers (the board and the
        advisory council).</t>

        <t>It is for further study whether current IETF leadership (e.g., IAB Chair) should
        continue to be part of these boards or councils.</t>

    <section title="Conclusions and recommendations" anchor="conc_recs">

      <t>While there are some initial conclusions in the analysis in the previous
      sections, clearly more work is needed. In particular, we request and welcome thoughts and contributions
      from the IETF community, particularly regarding any potential missed
      options or the implications of options being considered here.</t>
